Pipeline Sufficiency - Power BI Dashboard

Situation:
The sales team faced challenges in efficiently tracking rapidly changing deal statuses on a weekly basis. This complexity hindered their ability to identify bottlenecks and optimize the pipeline, limiting opportunities for conversion and growth.

Task:
The objective was to create a dynamic solution that provided granular insights into the sales pipeline segmented by key dimensions such as Route to Market, Products, and a three-level geographical hierarchy (Geo, Region, and Country). The solution also needed to forecast pipeline sufficiency for the current quarter and the next two quarters, driving better decision-making.

Action:
A Power BI Dashboard was developed to address these challenges. Key actions included:
•	Designing interactive visualizations to highlight bottlenecks and deal progression.
•	Incorporating detailed segmentation across critical dimensions like geography, products, and routes to market.
•	Leveraging real-time data to track weekly deal status changes and identify growth opportunities.

Result:
The dashboard led to a 15% increase in sales conversion rates by enabling the sales team to identify and address pipeline bottlenecks effectively. Its comprehensive granularity empowered stakeholders with actionable insights, ensuring proactive planning and improved decision-making. This solution significantly enhanced pipeline management, contributing to overall sales growth and operational efficiency.
