## Situation
- Low user engagement with a newly introduced feature was significantly hindering its adoption rates and customer retention for the SaaS product.
- The challenge was to identify the reasons for low engagement and optimize the feature to increase its usability and retention.

## Task
- The primary task was to design and implement a robust A/B testing strategy to assess different versions of the feature.
- The objective was to identify which version would resonate best with users and deliver the highest engagement and retention.
-  This involved setting up controlled experiments, defining metrics to track success, and ensuring statistically sound testing for optimal results.

## Action
- Executed A/B tests on multiple versions of the feature using advanced techniques like Bayesian Model, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Synthetic Test-Control.
-  Employed statistical hypothesis testing and utilized Bagging, Boosting, and Ensembling methods to evaluate and optimize the featureâ€™s performance across different user segments.

## Result
- The A/B testing strategy successfully increased the feature's adoption rate by 20% and improved customer satisfaction scores by 15%.
-  This resulted in enhanced product engagement, higher customer retention, and optimized overall performance of the SaaS feature.
