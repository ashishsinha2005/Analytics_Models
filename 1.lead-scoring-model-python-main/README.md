# Lead Scoring Model


# Situation:

- The sales team struggled with inefficient lead prioritization, leading to delayed follow-ups and missed opportunities.
- The absence of accurate lead scoring models hampered their ability to focus on high-priority leads, negatively impacting pipeline performance.

# Task:
- The objective was to improve the lead scoring process within Salesforce by leveraging machine learning to enhance accuracy and efficiency, ultimately reducing response time and optimizing sales outcomes.

# Action:
- The lead scoring models were revamped using advanced machine learning techniques.
- Implemented Bagging and Boosting algorithms to enhance the stability and performance of predictions.
- Built ensemble models to combine multiple classifiers, improving lead scoring accuracy and reliability.
-	Integrated the models into Salesforce to streamline lead prioritization and enable real-time scoring for the sales team.

#Result:
- The improved lead scoring system reduced response time by 20%, allowing the sales team to focus on high-value opportunities.
- The enhanced accuracy in lead prioritization significantly improved pipeline efficiency, demonstrating the impact of machine learning in driving sales performance.

### Solution:

Use several classification model to predict whether the lead is going to quantify as a hot lead. The steps involved for this case study are mentioned below:


1) Data Loading
2) Data Exploration a.k.a Exploratory Data Analysis
3) Preprocessing
4) Feature Engineering
5) Outlier Analysis
6) Model Building
7) Model Performance Benchmarking
8) Model Performance Evaluation
9) Cross Validation + Hyperparameter Tuning
10) Model Diagnosis Using Probability Calibration, ROC AUC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve
