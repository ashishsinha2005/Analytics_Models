## Customer Journey Optimization and Marketing-sales alignment

The sales team faced challenges in accelerating revenue realization by moving future quarter deals into the current quarter. The dataset used for predictions was highly imbalanced, making it difficult to identify actionable opportunities for deal closure within the quarter.

## Situation:

The goal was to build a predictive model to identify deals with a high likelihood of closing in the current quarter, thereby expediting revenue recognition and improving sales outcomes.

## Task:

A machine learning approach was implemented to address the challenge:
•	Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the dataset, improving the model’s ability to predict successful outcomes.
•	Logistic Regression was applied to estimate the likelihood of deals closing within the current quarter based on historical deal data and relevant features.


## Action:

The solution successfully moved $20M worth of deals into the current quarter, resulting in a 30% acceleration in revenue realization. By leveraging SMOTE to handle data imbalance and logistic regression for prediction, the project enabled the sales team to prioritize and act on high-probability deals, driving faster revenue growth.



## Result:
The Optimized Partner Mapping solution enabled the organization to focus its efforts on larger partners, driving a 30% growth in enterprise-level deals and larger contracts. By leveraging actionable insights from clustering, the sales and partner management teams were able to allocate resources effectively and establish targeted strategies that maximized revenue potential.
