Implementation of K-Means and Principal Component Analysis from scratch in Python 3.0 and in scikit learn.

## Situation:

The organization sought to improve revenue growth by prioritizing larger, high-potential partners. Traditional methods of partner segmentation were ineffective in identifying and targeting those partners capable of driving enterprise-level deals and contracts. A more data-driven approach was required to achieve measurable business growth.

## Task:

The objective was to design a solution that segmented partners based on their business potential and historical sales data, enabling a focused approach to resource allocation and strategic engagement. This would allow the organization to achieve a 30% growth in enterprise-level deals and larger contracts.

## Action:

The project employed advanced clustering techniques to group partners into meaningful segments.
•	K-means clustering was utilized to group partners based on features such as revenue, deal size, and sales potential.
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality and highlight key features that significantly impacted clustering.
The model leveraged historical sales data and business indicators to identify high-priority partners with the greatest growth potential.

## Result:
The Optimized Partner Mapping solution enabled the organization to focus its efforts on larger partners, driving a 30% growth in enterprise-level deals and larger contracts. By leveraging actionable insights from clustering, the sales and partner management teams were able to allocate resources effectively and establish targeted strategies that maximized revenue potential.
