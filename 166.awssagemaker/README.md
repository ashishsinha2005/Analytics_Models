## License Renewal Prediction Model & Deployement in AWS sagemaker with S3 Bucket

## Situation:

- Business faced challenges in identifying customers who were unlikely to renew their licenses.
- This resulted in revenue loss, inefficient allocation of marketing resources, and missed opportunities for proactive retention strategies.

## Task:

- The objective was to build a predictive system that could classify customers based on their likelihood of renewing licenses. 
- This would help the business focus its efforts on high-risk accounts to improve retention and stabilize revenue streams.




## Action:

- Developed a machine learning-based classification model using Random Forest and XGBoost. 
-  The system was implemented on AWS infrastructure, leveraging S3 buckets for data storage, Boto3 for seamless AWS service interaction, IAM roles for secure access, and SageMaker for training and deploying models.


## Result:
- The model improved license renewal prediction accuracy by 35%, leading to a 30% increase in renewals. 
- This proactive approach saved $2 million annually in retention efforts and optimized resource allocation.
