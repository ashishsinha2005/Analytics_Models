# Function to optimize budget allocation for a set of channels
# Given the total 'budget', coefficients 'coeff_A' for each channel, and channel names 'ch_names',
# this function uses the GEKKO optimization library to find an optimized budget allocation
# while considering upper-bound constraints for each channel. The function maximizes the value of
# the objective function based on coefficients and prints the budget allocation for each channel.
